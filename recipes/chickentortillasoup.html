    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This chicken tortilla soup tastes better than anything you can get at a restaurant. It's healthy, too! Don't let the long list of ingredients fool you. All you do is dump everything into the slow cooker and walk away. Garnish with grated Cheddar, avocados, and a splash of fresh lime juice.</p>
